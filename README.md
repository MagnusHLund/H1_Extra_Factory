# H1_Extra_Factory

3 out of 4 difficulty extra assignment.

This project acts like a factory line, in which you have to put items into boxes.
Without moving the order of the items, the program has to create boxes which can contain a maximum of 10kg. 
Once a box has reached its weight limit, it has to change the box, and then repeat until there are no more products.
